# Enterprise Readiness Notes - EcoTide

Updated: 2026-05-30

This note defines what an enterprise buyer, public-sector reviewer, serious user, or technical evaluator can safely infer from this repository today. It is intentionally conservative: public proof is separated from production claims.

## Scope

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| Repository | `ecotide` |
| Lane | B2C/B2B education simulation |
| Primary reader or buyer | Mobile product reviewers, educators, workshop creators, and SwiftUI teams. |
| Core wedge | Native simulation app showing motion telemetry, scenario replay, and calm mobile craft. |
| Stack | Swift |
| Readiness posture | Public demo or product experiment with enterprise-grade privacy and release expectations where applicable. |

## Enterprise Controls

| Control | Current expectation |
|---|---|
| Data boundary | Student or cohort data requires consent, retention limits, export/delete paths, and clear advisory-only positioning. |
| Identity and access | Keep the first session account-light; add identity only for sync, paid access, team views, or data export. |
| Auditability | Keep decision logs, generated reports, CI results, eval outputs, and operator handoff artifacts reviewable. |
| Observability | Track activation, completion, opt-in sync, export/delete usage, errors, and abuse signals without over-collecting personal data. |
| Release gate | Build check: swift build |
| Support handoff | Name the owner, escalation path, rollback path, known limits, and review cadence before a paid or production pilot. |

## Verification Surface

| Purpose | Command |
|---|---|
| Build check | `swift build` |

## CI Surface

- .github/workflows/architecture-blueprint.yml
- .github/workflows/ci.yml
- .github/workflows/dependency-review.yml
- .github/workflows/pages-auto-deploy.yml
- .github/workflows/repository-health.yml
- .github/workflows/repository-surface.yml
- .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml

## Acceptance Criteria

- swift build can be run or the equivalent CI gate is visible.
- README, review guide, quality notes, revenue model, and this readiness note agree on the same scope.
- Demo, fixture, synthetic, or public-data boundaries are explicit before a buyer sees outputs.
- A reviewer can identify the first useful outcome without reading implementation details.
- Production claims stay behind customer-specific validation, access control, monitoring, and support handoff.

## Integration Path

- Ship a friction-light public demo or app flow that proves first-session value.
- Add consented account, sync, paid pack, or team/cohort layer only after the core loop is useful.
- Measure retention, support issues, opt-outs, and refund/cancel signals before broad monetization.

## Proof Points

- CLI smoke passes
- Motion fallback is explicit
- Review pack is generated

## Operating Metrics

- Scenario completions
- Workshop adoption
- App retention

## Open Risks

- Telemetry privacy
- Avoid scientific accuracy overclaims
- Motion data opt-in

## Finish Line

- Keep the public repository honest, runnable, and easy to review.
- Keep sensitive data, secrets, private tenant details, and unsupported claims out of public artifacts.
- Treat this repository as a proof surface until an approved pilot defines users, data, access, monitoring, support, and success metrics.
